\f0\fs24 \cf0 This prototype was developed on a Mac.\

For some reason, the interactions with the green NPC\'92s tend to skip dialogue lines, so I\'92ll include the instructions below (everything they should say in the interactions):\
\
1 = "Hey! Come talk to me! Use 'A' and 'D' to move and press 'K' to interact...";\
2 = "If you want to jump, press 'J'...";\
3 = "You can wall climb by jumping while pushing your character against the wall...";\
4 = "But be careful, you can only jump three times before you'll have to hit the ground again...";\
5 = "You can keep an eye on your jump power with those three bars in the top left corner...";\
6 = "Press 'SPACE' to attack enemies. Keep in mind it might take a few hits to take them down...";\
7 = "Collect fish to replenish your health...";\
8 = "If you need to pause the game, press 'ESC'...";\
9 = "To access your inventory, press 'I'...";\
10 = "From there, you can view any items you've collected...";\
11 = "You can even change your character skin someday!...";\
12 = "Come back if you need help!";\
___________\
\
 1 = "Pssst! I have a secret for you!";\
 2 = "See that box right there?";\
 3 = "That's no ordinary box. That's a vent!";\
 4 = "Stand in front of it and press 'E', and see where it takes you!";}
